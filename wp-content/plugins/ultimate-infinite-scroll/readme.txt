Ultimate Infinite Lazy Load, Ajax Scroll Solution for WordPress Blog posts and WooCommerce products

== Description ==

The Ultimate Infinite Scroll for WooCommerce revolutionizes the product browsing experience on your WooCommerce store by replacing traditional pagination with smooth AJAX infinite scroll. This plugin ensures that customers no longer need to click through pages to view more products. As users scroll, new products seamlessly load without refreshing the entire page, making your WooCommerce store faster, more engaging, and reducing bounce rates.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Infinite scroll keeps users engaged by continuously loading products as they scroll.
